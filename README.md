## overview

Containerization is a system of intermodal freight transport
using intermodal containers (also called shipping containers
and ISO containers). Containerization is also referred as
"Container Stuffing" or "Container Loading", which is the
process of unitization of cargoes in exports. Containerization
is the predominant form of unitization of export cargoes unlike
other systems viz the barge system or the palletization. The
containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded
and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long
distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to
another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and
semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling
system is completely mechanized so that all handling is done
with cranes and special forklift trucks. All containers are
numbered and tracked using computerized systems.

Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting
system software and libraries, many of which are provided
by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word
"Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation
uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the importance of
GNU software, causing some controversy.

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products
that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in
packages called containers. Containers are isolated from
one another and bundle their own software, libraries and
configuration files; they can communicate with each other
through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers
share the services of a single operating system kernel,
they use fewer resources than virtual machines.
